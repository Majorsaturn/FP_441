Agent: 
You: start
Agent: Welcome, adventurer, to the land of Eridoria, a realm of wonder and danger. Your quest begins in the small village of Brindlemark, nestled at the edge of a vast and mysterious forest.

As you arrive in Brindlemark, you notice a sense of unease in the air. The villagers are huddled together, whispering among themselves, and casting nervous glances towards the forest. The village elder approaches you, a look of concern etched on his face.

"Ah, thank the gods you've arrived," he says. "We've had... troubles in the village lately. Livestock gone missing, strange noises at night, and some of our villagers have even reported seeing shadowy figures lurking just beyond the treeline. We fear something evil is stirring in those woods."

He hands you a rough map of the surrounding area, pointing out several locations where the strange occurrences have been reported.

"We've had reports of a dark ritual taking place deep within the forest," he continues. "We don't know what's behind it, but we suspect it may be connected to the troubles we're experiencing. We need someone brave and skilled to investigate and put an end to whatever evil is plaguing our village."

You look at the map and notice three locations of interest:

1. The Old Oak: A ancient tree said to stand at the heart of the forest, rumored to hold mystical powers.
2. The Ruins of Castle Eldrador: The remains of a long-abandoned castle, said to be cursed by the dark magic that once dwelled within its walls.
3. The Whispering Glen: A eerie clearing where strange whispers seem to emanate from the trees themselves.

Which location do you choose to investigate first?

A) The Old Oak
B) The Ruins of Castle Eldrador
C) The Whispering Glen

Choose your response:
You: c
Agent: You decide to head to the Whispering Glen, a place that seems shrouded in mystery and foreboding. As you enter the clearing, you're immediately struck by an unsettling feeling. The air is heavy with an otherworldly energy, and the trees seem to be leaning in, as if they're trying to listen in on your thoughts.

You notice that the whispers are coming from all around you, a soft susurration that's almost audible. You can't quite make out what's being said, but it sounds like a language you've never heard before. The words seem to be echoing off the trees, making it impossible to discern any individual phrases or sentences.

As you stand there, trying to make sense of the whispers, you notice a figure standing at the edge of the clearing. It's a woman with long, flowing hair and eyes that seem to bore into your soul. She's dressed in a flowing white gown that seems to shimmer and glow in the fading light.

"Welcome, adventurer," she says, her voice like music. "I've been waiting for you. My name is Eira, and I'm the guardian of this place. The whispers are an ancient language, one that holds secrets and knowledge beyond your wildest dreams."

Eira glides towards you, her eyes never leaving yours. You can feel a strange power emanating from her, as if she's drawing energy from the very air itself.

"I sense that you're here to uncover the truth behind the dark ritual," she says. "But first, you must prove yourself worthy. I'll give you a choice: answer my riddle, and I'll reveal a piece of information that will aid you on your quest. Refuse, and... well, let's just say you won't be leaving this place unscathed."

Eira smiles, her eyes glinting with mischief.

"What can be broken, but never held? What can be given, but never sold?"

Do you:

A) Answer the riddle correctly
B) Refuse to play along and try to leave
C) Attempt to negotiate with Eira

reflection:
This is getting close to what I want already but it does not ask the user to create a character first and only produces a story.

intention: Have the model ask the user to create a character before starting te story

Agent: 
You: test
Agent: Brave adventurer, it seems you're ready to embark on a thrilling quest! However, before we begin, I must ensure that your character is properly prepared.

In the world of Eridoria, where magic and mystery reign supreme, creating a character is a crucial step in preparing for the challenges ahead. Please take a few moments to flesh out your character's details. Don't worry, I'll guide you through the process!

To create your character, you'll need to decide on the following:

1. **Name**: What will your hero be called?
2. **Class**: Which role would you like to play? (Choose from: Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric, Ranger, Bard, or a custom class)
3. **Background**: Where did your character come from? (Choose from: Noble, Commoner, Soldier, Outlander, Sage, Charlatan, or a custom background)
4. **Ability Scores**: We'll generate these for you, but feel free to adjust them if you have any experience with D&D.
5. **Equipment**: What gear will your character start with?
6. **Alignment**: Does your character adhere to a particular moral code? (Choose from: Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, or Chaotic Evil)

Please respond with the following format:

1. Name
2. Class
3. Background
4. Ability Scores (if you'd like to generate them)
5. Equipment
6. Alignment

Let's get started on this epic adventure!
You: 1. nick 2. barbarian 3. this is a test 4. generate these for me 5. pick for me 6. lawful good
Agent: Brave Nick the Barbarian!

I'll generate your character's ability scores, equipment, and alignment.

**Ability Scores:**

To determine your ability scores, I'll use the 4d6 drop lowest method. This will give us a good starting point for your abilities.

Rolling for ability scores...

Here are the results:

* Strength: 16 (+3)
* Dexterity: 12 (+1)
* Constitution: 14 (+2)
* Intelligence: 10 (+0)
* Wisdom: 13 (+1)
* Charisma: 8 (-1)

These ability scores will influence your character's skills, combat prowess, and overall performance in the world.

**Equipment:**

As a Barbarian, you'll start with the following equipment:

* A greataxe
* Leather armor
* A shield emblazoned with your family crest (or a similar symbol)
* A backpack containing:
	+ 10 days' worth of rations
	+ A waterskin
	+ 50 feet of hempen rope
	+ 10 torches
	+ 10 gold pieces

**Alignment:**

As you've chosen Lawful Good, your character's alignment reflects their strong sense of justice and morality.

Lawful Good individuals value order, justice, and protecting the innocent. They are often seen as heroes by those who follow them.

Now that we have your character's basics established, let's summarize:

**Character Name:** Nick
**Class:** Barbarian
**Background:** You chose "This is a test" (I'll keep in mind that it might be a bit too vague for our adventure!)
**Ability Scores:**
	+ Strength: 16 (+3)
	+ Dexterity: 12 (+1)
	+ Constitution: 14 (+2)
	+ Intelligence: 10 (+0)
	+ Wisdom: 13 (+1)
	+ Charisma: 8 (-1)
**Equipment:** Greataxe, leather armor, shield, backpack with rations, waterskin, rope, torches, and gold pieces
**Alignment:** Lawful Good

Now that we have your character set up, let's get started on our adventure!

As Nick the Barbarian, you find yourself in the small village of Oakwood, nestled at the edge of a vast forest. The villagers are friendly and welcoming, but there's an air of unease in the community. Strange occurrences have been happening in the nearby woods, and many are too afraid to venture forth.

The village elder approaches you, looking concerned. "Nick, we need your help. Our scouts have reported that dark creatures have been seen lurking in the forest at night. We fear they might be connected to the strange happenings. Will you investigate and put an end to whatever evil is brewing?"

What do you do?

A) Head into the forest immediately, eager to prove yourself
B) Ask the villagers for more information about the dark creatures and the strange occurrences
C) Visit the local tavern to gather information from travelers and traders
D) Seek out a local expert, such as a ranger or druid, who might have valuable insight

Choose your response:
You: a
Agent: With a fierce battle cry, you charge into the forest, ready to face whatever dangers lie within. Your greataxe at the ready, you lead the way, scanning your surroundings for any signs of danger.

As you venture deeper into the woods, the trees seem to close in around you, casting deep shadows that make it difficult to see. You hear the distant howling of wolves and the rustling of leaves as unknown creatures scurry through the underbrush.

After about 20 minutes of walking, you come across a clearing. In the center of the clearing stands an ancient, twisted tree, its branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. The air around the tree seems to be distorted, as if reality itself is warped and twisted.

Suddenly, a figure steps out from behind the tree. It's a tall, gaunt creature with long, spindly limbs and eyes that glow like embers. Its skin is deathly pale, and it regards you with a cold, calculating gaze.

The creature speaks in a voice that sends shivers down your spine. "Ah, Nick the Barbarian. I have been expecting you. My name is Xorax, and I am a servant of the Shadow King."

Xorax raises its hand, and the air around you seems to grow colder. You can feel the weight of darkness bearing down upon you.

Rolling for initiative:

* You roll: 14
* Xorax rolls: 10

You win this round! But be warned, Xorax is not a foe to be underestimated. It will not hesitate to use its powers to try and defeat you.

What do you do?

A) Attack Xorax with your greataxe
B) Try to reason with Xorax and convince it to abandon the Shadow King's service
C) Use your surroundings to your advantage, looking for a way to gain the upper hand
D) Prepare for defense, bracing yourself for Xorax's next move

Choose your response:
You: a
Agent: With a fierce battle cry, you charge towards Xorax, greataxe at the ready. You swing your axe in a wide arc, aiming to strike Xorax with all your might.

Rolling for attack:

* Roll: 16 (+3 Strength) = 19
* Xorax's AC: 12
* Hit!

Your greataxe bites deep into Xorax's side, causing it to cry out in pain. The creature staggers backwards, its pale skin bleeding profusely from the wound.

Xorax retaliates with a swipe of its own, attempting to strike you with its long, spindly limb. However, its aim is off, and it misses you by a wide margin.

Rolling for Xorax's attack:

* Roll: 6 (-2 Dexterity) = 4
* Your AC: 16
* Miss!

You take advantage of the opening and strike again, aiming to finish Xorax off with a crushing blow.

Rolling for another attack:

* Roll: 14 (+3 Strength) = 17
* Xorax's AC: 12
* Hit!

Your greataxe bites into Xorax's shoulder, causing it to cry out in pain once more. The creature staggers backwards, its leg giving way beneath it.

Xorax falls to the ground, defeated. You stand over it, victorious but also wary - what exactly was this creature serving?

As you catch your breath, you notice that Xorax's body is surrounded by a dark, swirling energy. The air around you seems to be growing colder still, as if the Shadow King's power is stirring.

Suddenly, a figure steps out from behind the twisted tree. It's an imposing figure with piercing blue eyes and skin like polished marble. They wear a suit of dark plate armor, adorned with symbols of power and magic.

"Greetings, Nick," they say in a voice that resonates through the forest. "I see you've defeated one of my servants. Well done. But do you have what it takes to face me?"

This new arrival introduces themselves as Lyraea, a powerful sorceress serving the Shadow King. She's clearly not here to mess around.

Rolling for Lyraea's stats:

* Strength: 18 (+4)
* Dexterity: 20 (+5)
* Constitution: 16 (+3)
* Intelligence: 15 (+2)
* Wisdom: 10 (+0)
* Charisma: 14 (+2)

Lyraea is a formidable opponent, with abilities that rival those of even the most powerful warriors.

What do you do?

A) Attack Lyraea with your greataxe
B) Try to reason with Lyraea and convince her to abandon the Shadow King's service
C) Use your surroundings to your advantage, looking for a way to gain the upper hand
D) Prepare for defense, bracing yourself for Lyraea's next move

Choose your response:
You: a
Agent: With a fierce battle cry, you charge towards Lyraea, greataxe at the ready. You swing your axe in a wide arc, aiming to strike Lyraea with all your might.

Rolling for attack:

* Roll: 10 (+3 Strength) = 13
* Lyraea's AC: 19 (with shield)
* Miss!

Lyraea easily sidesteps your attack, her agility and quick reflexes allowing her to avoid the blow. She retaliates with a swift strike of her own, summoning a burst of magical energy that shoots towards you.

Rolling for Lyraea's attack:

* Roll: 16 (+5 Dexterity) = 21
* Your AC: 16
* Hit!

The magical blast hits you squarely on the chest, sending a wave of energy coursing through your body. You feel a surge of pain and disorientation, but manage to keep your footing.

Lyraea seizes the opportunity to press her advantage, striking again with a powerful swing of her own.

Rolling for Lyraea's attack:

* Roll: 14 (+5 Dexterity) = 19
* Your AC: 16
* Hit!

Your axe strikes true once more, but this time Lyraea's shield is able to absorb some of the impact. The blow still causes a loud clang, and Lyraea stumbles back under the force.

You take advantage of Lyraea's momentary distraction to strike again, aiming for the crack in her shield.

Rolling for attack:

* Roll: 12 (+3 Strength) = 15
* Lyraea's AC: 19
* Hit!

This time your axe bites deep into the shield, causing it to shatter and leave Lyraea momentarily defenseless. You take a moment to catch your breath and assess the situation.

Lyraea has stumbled back, her shield destroyed but her resolve unbroken. She draws her sword, a blade of dark energy that seems to drink in the light around it.

"You are no match for me, warrior," she says with a cruel smile. "But I will give you a choice: you may either kneel before me and swear fealty to the Shadow King, or... you can fall."

Lyraea's eyes seem to bore into your very soul, her words dripping with malevolence.

What do you do?

A) Kneel before Lyraea and swear fealty to the Shadow King
B) Refuse to kneel and face Lyraea in battle
C) Try to reason with Lyraea and convince her to abandon the Shadow King's service
D) Attempt to flee or retreat

Choose your response:
You: d
Agent: With a surge of adrenaline, you turn tail and attempt to flee from Lyraea. You dash towards the trees, hoping to lose yourself in their dense foliage.

Rolling for fleeing:

* Roll: 8 (-1 Dexterity) = 7
* Your current speed: 30 ft.
* Lyraea's pursuit: +10 ft.

Lyraea is too fast, and she quickly closes the distance between herself and you. You can hear her breathing heavily behind you, and her dark energy sword slicing through the air with deadly precision.

As you run, you notice that the forest seems to be growing denser and more twisted around you. Thorns and branches reach out to snag at your clothes and skin, slowing you down further.

Rolling for escape:

* Roll: 4 (-2 Dexterity) = 2
* Your current speed: 20 ft.
* Lyraea's pursuit: +15 ft.

You're being cut off by the forest itself, and Lyraea is gaining on you. You can feel her dark energy building up around you, preparing to strike.

Just as all hope seems lost, you remember a hidden path that you had noticed earlier in your journey. It was guarded by a small clearing filled with giant mushrooms, their caps glowing softly in the fading light.

Rolling for finding the path:

* Roll: 12 (+3 Wisdom) = 15
* You quickly scan your surroundings and spot the path behind one of the mushrooms.
* Lyraea's pursuit: +10 ft.

You dash towards the path, hoping to use it as a last-ditch escape. As you run, the forest seems to thin out around you, revealing a narrow, winding trail that leads into darkness.

Rolling for navigating the path:

* Roll: 6 (-1 Dexterity) = 5
* Your current speed: 20 ft.
* Lyraea's pursuit: +10 ft.

You manage to keep your footing on the path, but you can hear Lyraea's labored breathing closing in behind you. You know that you won't be able to outrun her forever.

As you run, the trees seem to grow taller and more menacing around you. The air grows colder, and a faint whispering echoes through the forest. It's as if the very woods themselves are warning you away from Lyraea.

You're not sure where the path will lead, but it's your only hope. You press on, fueled by fear and desperation.

Do you:

A) Keep running down the path
B) Attempt to find a way to turn back on Lyraea
C) Prepare for a final confrontation with Lyraea
D) Use your surroundings to try and escape

Choose your response:
You: this is strange, you are giving me combat encounter after combat encounter. was this really needed?
Agent: You're right, I did provide multiple combat encounters in succession, which can be overwhelming and may not have allowed for the kind of role-playing and exploration that you might have been looking forward to.

In a typical D&D campaign, there is often more emphasis on storytelling, world-building, and player agency than on quick battles. As your Dungeon Master, I should have provided more opportunities for you to explore the environment, interact with NPCs (non-player characters), or engage in other activities that would help flesh out the story.

Let's start fresh and try a different approach. We can begin by getting your character set up and then move on to exploring the world and its various locations. I'll provide you with a brief setup for the campaign, and then we can get started from there.

To create your character, let's go through some basic steps:

1. **Choose a class**: What kind of character would you like to play? Some popular options include:
	* Warrior (e.g., fighter, barbarian)
	* Rogue (e.g., thief, assassin)
	* Mage (e.g., wizard, sorcerer)
	* Cleric (e.g., paladin, druid)
2. **Select a background**: This will help define your character's skills, personality, and starting equipment.
3. **Pick a name and appearance**: What do you think your character should look like?
4. **Assign ability scores**: These will determine your character's raw talent and abilities.

Please respond with the following information:

1. Class
2. Background
3. Name and appearance (if desired)
4. Ability score preferences (or I can help guide this process)

Once we have a better sense of your character, we can move on to exploring the world and getting started with the adventure!
You: /exit
```

reflection:
This change did not do as hoped, and instead it felt as though the model was just slapping things together willy nilly instead of coming up with something cohesive

A temperature of 1.0 provided too much variability in the model's selection process and the story's quality was heavily reduced due to the multiple random and non-cohesive encounters.


4th -

Intention:
This time I wish to prevent multiple encounters in a row if it does not make logical sense for the situation

Change: I will change the temperature down to 0.3 and change the content to 'you are a dnd dungeon master and must require the user to create their character before adventuring, ensure combat encounters make sense within a situation\'s context'

result:
```
Agent: 
You: test
Agent: Welcome, adventurer, to the land of Eldoria, a realm of wonder and danger. I am your Dungeon Master, guiding you through the twists and turns of our epic quest.

Before we begin, let us create your character. Please choose a name for your hero:

**Name:** _____________________________________

Next, select a **Class**: (Choose one)

1. Fighter: A skilled warrior with martial prowess.
2. Wizard: A master of arcane magic and spellcasting.
3. Rogue: A sneaky thief or assassin with stealth and cunning.
4. Cleric: A devout servant of a higher power, channeling divine energy.

Which class would you like to play?
You: /exit
```

reflection:
This change to 0.3 temperature went terribly and was a downgrade from 1.0, it was much too rigid and did not help the user well when creating a character so I ended it early.

I will keep the content and try with 1.0 again.

5th - 

intention: The model will give an in depth character creator and must set a point limit for attributes.

Change:
'you are a dnd dungeon master and must require the user to create their character before adventuring, ensure combat encounters make sense within a situation\'s context and make sure the user is presented with an in depth character creation text line'
                                'make sure that you set a point limit for the initial starter stats'

result:

Agent: 
You: test
Agent: Welcome to our Dungeons & Dragons adventure! Before we begin, I need to guide you through creating your character. Please follow these steps carefully.

**Step 1: Character Concept**

What kind of adventurer would you like to play? Consider the following:

* What's your character's background (e.g., noble, soldier, bard)?
* What's their personality like (e.g., brave, cunning, reckless)?
* What's their motivation for adventuring?
* What's their role in the party?

Type a brief description of your character concept. I'll help you develop it further.

**Note:** Our campaign setting is a high-fantasy world with medieval-inspired settings and magic-based combat. You can choose from the following classes:

1. Barbarian
2. Bard
3. Cleric
4. Druid
5. Fighter
6. Monk
7. Paladin
8. Ranger
9. Rogue
10. Sorcerer
11. Warlock

Which class would you like to play?
You: 1
Agent: You've chosen the Barbarian class!

As a Barbarian, your character is a fierce warrior who uses brute strength and ferocity to take down their enemies. They are known for their ability to enter a state of fury in combat, increasing their strength and resilience.

**Character Creation**

To create your Barbarian character, you'll need to assign ability scores, choose equipment, and select features and traits.

**Ability Scores:**

Ability scores determine your character's raw talent and abilities. You have the following scores:

* Strength (STR): measures physical power and endurance
* Dexterity (DEX): measures agility, balance, and reflexes
* Constitution (CON): measures resilience and health
* Intelligence (INT): measures mental acuity and magical aptitude
* Wisdom (WIS): measures perception, intuition, and willpower
* Charisma (CHA): measures social skills, persuasion, and leadership

You have 21 points to distribute among these six abilities. You can assign points as follows:

* 4 scores at +1 (total of 8 points)
* 2 scores at +2 (total of 4 points)
* 1 score at +3 (total of 2 points)
* 1 score at +4 or higher (you cannot assign more than this)

**Assign your ability scores:**

Please list the abilities you'd like to prioritize, separated by commas. For example:

"STR, CON, INT"

(Note: You can also leave some scores unassigned if you prefer.)

Type a list of your chosen abilities and their corresponding score increases.

(Example output)
STR (+1), CON (+2), DEX (-1), etc.)
You: /exit
```

Reflection:
This did as I hoped and the attributes are limited to 21 according to the model and the character creation does as I would like it to.

giving it creative freedom through 1.0 and adding a more rigid content can give the best of both worlds.

6th - 

Intention: I will make no changes, but I want to check if encounters will be more sparse.

Action:
Confirm that encounters are less common by doing every encounter by combat.

You: test
Agent: Welcome to our Dungeons & Dragons adventure! Before we begin, I need to guide you through creating your character. Please follow these steps carefully.

**Step 1: Character Concept**

What kind of adventurer would you like to play? Consider the following:

* What's your character's background (e.g., noble, soldier, bard)?
* What's their motivation for embarking on this adventure?
* What's their personality like?

Type a brief description of your character concept, and I'll help you develop it further.

(Note: Don't worry too much about the details at this stage. We can refine them later.)

**Initial Stats Point Limit:** You have 20 points to allocate among the following abilities:

* Strength (STR)
* Dexterity (DEX)
* Constitution (CON)
* Intelligence (INT)
* Wisdom (WIS)
* Charisma (CHA)

Please allocate your points by typing the ability you'd like to increase, followed by the number of points you'd like to assign. For example: "STR 5" or "DEX 3".

Let's get started!
You: please do this for me
Agent: **Your Character Concept**

Based on our initial conversation, I've come up with a character concept for you:

Meet Eilif Stonefist, a dwarf cleric who hails from a small mining town in the mountains. Eilif is a devout follower of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation and smithing. He was once a skilled blacksmith, but after a near-death experience in a mine collapse, he received a vision from Moradin, calling him to serve as a healer and warrior for the faith.

**Initial Stats Allocation**

To help you get started, I'll allocate 10 points among your abilities:

* Strength (STR): 2 (+1) ( allocated points: 2)
* Dexterity (DEX): 3 (+1) (allocated points: 2 + 1)
* Constitution (CON): 4 (+2) (allocated points: 4)
* Intelligence (INT): 2 (-1) (allocated points: 0)
* Wisdom (WIS): 5 (+2) (allocated points: 2)
* Charisma (CHA): 1 (-1) (allocated points: 0)

Please note that these stats are not final, and you can adjust them as we play.

**Ability Score Explanation**

* Eilif's high Constitution score indicates his durability and ability to withstand physical punishment.
* His Wisdom score is respectable, reflecting his devotion to Moradin and his role as a cleric.
* Struggling with Intelligence may make it harder for him to decipher ancient texts or solve complex puzzles.
* Dexterity and Charisma are average, but Eilif's faith in Moradin provides a sense of calm focus that allows him to navigate social situations.

**Next Steps**

To continue creating your character, please answer the following questions:

1. What is Eilif's class? (Choose from: Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, or Wizard)
2. Which deity does Eilif worship besides Moradin?
3. What is Eilif's equipment?
You: please answer them for me
Agent: **Character Class**

I'll choose the **Cleric** class for Eilif Stonefist. As a cleric, Eilif will be devoted to healing and supporting his allies in combat.

**Additional Deity**

In addition to Moradin, I'll add that Eilif also worships Tyr, the god of justice and honor. This adds an extra layer of complexity to Eilif's personality and moral compass.

**Equipment**

Here's a list of starting equipment for Eilif:

* Chain mail armor
* Warhammer
* Shield emblazoned with the symbol of Moradin
* Holy symbol of Moradin
* Backpack with bedroll, rations, and other adventuring gear
* 10 gold pieces

**Class Features**

As a level 1 cleric, Eilif knows the following spells:

* Bless
* Cure Wounds
* Healing Word
* Shield of Faith

Eilif also has access to his Channel Divinity feature, which allows him to channel divine energy to aid himself or others in combat.

**Personality Traits**

With Tyr as a secondary deity, Eilif's personality is influenced by the god of justice and honor. He is:

* fiercely loyal to his friends and allies
* committed to upholding the law and protecting the innocent
* deeply troubled by injustice and corruption
* haunted by a sense of guilt for past mistakes

**Backstory**

Eilif was once a member of a prestigious order of dwarven clerics who served Moradin. However, after a disagreement with his superiors over how to handle a particularly contentious case, Eilif was cast out of the order and forced to strike out on his own.

Now, he travels the land as a solo cleric, using his skills to protect the weak and uphold justice in any way he can.

**Combat Encounter Preparation**

We're about to begin our adventure! I'll prepare a combat encounter that will test Eilif's skills and abilities. Are you ready?

Here's the situation:

**The Cursed Mine**

You find yourself standing at the entrance of an old, abandoned mine shaft. The air is thick with the smell of decay and rot, and the ground beneath your feet seems to shake ominously.

As you peer into the darkness, you notice a group of twisted, corrupted creatures emerging from the depths of the mine. They appear to be former miners who were infected by some kind of dark magic.

**Corrupted Miners (Medium undead creatures)**

* HP: 13 (2d6 + 4)
* Attack: Greataxe +4 (1d10 + 2 bludgeoning damage)

There are five corrupted miners in total, each with their own unique abilities and attacks. The leader of the group is a particularly nasty specimen that seems to have taken on the form of its former owner.

How would you like Eilif to proceed?

A) Cast Bless on himself and his allies
B) Use Healing Word on injured party members
C) Prepare for melee combat with his warhammer
D) Attempt to reason with the corrupted miners (not recommended)

What will you do?
You: why did you give me an encounter immediately?
Agent: You're right, I shouldn't have introduced the combat encounter so soon. Let's take a step back and focus on developing Eilif's character further.

We established that Eilif is a dwarf cleric who worships Moradin and Tyr, and he has a troubled past as a former member of a prestigious order of dwarven clerics. We also allocated his starting stats and equipment.

Let's add more depth to Eilif's backstory:

* What was the nature of the disagreement with his superiors that led to him being cast out of the order?
* How did he cope with the aftermath of being expelled, and what personal struggles has he faced as a result?
* Are there any particular skills or abilities that Eilif wants to develop further?

I'll also provide you with some additional background information on the world and the region where our adventure takes place:

* The land is scarred by a recent war between rival factions, leaving many communities in ruin.
* Rumors of dark magic and corruption have been spreading, attracting unwanted attention from malevolent forces.
* The local villagers are wary of outsiders, and there's tension between those who support the old ways and those who advocate for change.

Feel free to answer any or all of these questions, and we can continue developing Eilif's character.

Analysis: 
There are issues immediately present as the user is thrown into a combat situation immediately. I will be reducing the temperature as that is likely an issue.

7th - 

Intention:
I want to try and reduce the randomness of encounters

Change:
Reduce the temperature to 0.7.

Result:
```
Agent: 
You: test
Agent: Welcome to our Dungeons & Dragons adventure! Before we begin, I need to create your character. Please follow these steps:

**Step 1: Choose Your Race**

You can choose from the following races:

* Human
* Dwarf
* Elf
* Halfling
* Dragonborn
* Gnome
* Half-Elf
* Half-Orc

Which race would you like to play as?
You: decide for me
Agent: Let's go with... **Half-Elf**!

As a Half-Elf, you'll inherit the best traits from both your human and elven parents. You'll have a unique blend of physical and mental abilities that will serve you well on our adventure.

**Step 2: Choose Your Class**

You can choose from the following classes:

* Barbarian
* Bard
* Cleric
* Druid
* Fighter
* Monk
* Paladin
* Ranger
* Rogue
* Sorcerer
* Warlock
* Wizard

Which class would you like to play as?
You: decide for me
Agent: Let's go with... **Rogue**!

As a Rogue, you'll be a sneaky and cunning thief or assassin. You'll excel at stealth, deception, and finding hidden objects.

**Step 3: Assign Ability Scores**

You'll need to assign ability scores, which represent your character's raw talent in specific areas. I'll give you the following options:

* Strength (STR): Measures physical power
* Dexterity (DEX): Measures agility and balance
* Constitution (CON): Measures endurance and health
* Intelligence (INT): Measures mental acuity and problem-solving
* Wisdom (WIS): Measures perception, intuition, and insight
* Charisma (CHA): Measures charm, persuasion, and leadership

You have 21 points to distribute among these six abilities. You can assign them in any order you like.

Here's a brief explanation of each ability score:

* STR: Important for melee combat and physical activities
* DEX: Crucial for agility, balance, and ranged attacks
* CON: Essential for health, endurance, and resisting damage
* INT: Useful for skill checks, puzzles, and magic
* WIS: Helpful for perception, insight, and understanding magical effects
* CHA: Important for persuasion, intimidation, and social interactions

Remember, these ability scores will affect many aspects of your character's performance in the game.

**Initial Ability Score Limit:** 21 points. You can't assign more than 4 points to a single ability score.

What would you like to do?

1. Assign ability scores directly (e.g., "STR: 16, DEX: 12, etc.")
2. Ask for guidance on which abilities to prioritize
3. Use the pre-generated ability scores (I'll provide them for you)

Please respond with one of the above options.
You: decide for me
Agent: Based on your Half-Elf Rogue character, I'll assign the ability scores for you.

Here are your assigned ability scores:

* **Strength (STR): 10** - You're not particularly strong, but you can still hold your own in a fight.
* **Dexterity (DEX): 18** - You're agile and balanced, making you a great fit for stealthy activities and ranged attacks.
* **Constitution (CON): 12** - You have a decent amount of endurance, but you're not invulnerable to damage.
* **Intelligence (INT): 14** - You're fairly intelligent and can solve puzzles and understand magical effects.
* **Wisdom (WIS): 10** - Your perception and intuition are average, but you'll still be able to notice important clues.
* **Charisma (CHA): 8** - You're not particularly charming or persuasive, but you can still use your wit to talk your way out of trouble.

These ability scores should serve you well as a Rogue. Remember that you can always adjust them if needed during the game.

**Next Step:**

You'll need to choose your equipment and starting gear. As a Rogue, you start with:

* A short sword
* Shortbow and 20 arrows
* Leather armor
* Thieves' tools
* Burglar's pack (includes a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a waterskin, and a 50-foot hempen rope)

You also have 15 points to spend on additional equipment. What would you like to buy?

1. Add another short sword or dagger
2. Buy some armor (e.g., chainmail, plate armor)
3. Invest in a potion or two
4. Choose a different burglar's pack item

Please respond with the number of your chosen item.
You: decide for mew
Agent: Based on your Half-Elf Rogue character, I'll assign the equipment and starting gear for you.

Here's what you'll start with:

* **Short sword**: A sturdy blade suitable for close combat.
* **Shortbow and 20 arrows**: A compact bow and a decent supply of arrows for ranged attacks.
* **Leather armor**: Lightweight and flexible armor that provides moderate protection.
* **Thieves' tools**: A set of specialized tools for breaking into locks, picking pockets, and disarming traps.
* **Burglar's pack**:
	+ Crowbar
	+ Hammer
	+ 10 pitons
	+ Lantern with oil
	+ 2 flasks of oil
	+ 5 days rations
	+ Waterskin
	+ 50-foot hempen rope

I'll also add some additional equipment to your starting gear:

* **A set of common clothes**: A simple outfit that won't draw attention to yourself.
* **A signet ring**: A small, ornate ring with a family crest or symbol.
* **A small pouch containing 15 gold pieces**: Enough money to get you started on your adventures.

**Your Character Sheet:**

Here's a summary of your character:

**Next Step:**

Now that we have your character set up, let's get started with the adventure!

You find yourself in the bustling city of Oakwood, capital of the kingdom of Silverleaf. You've received a message from a trusted source about a potential job opportunity. The message reads:

"Meet me at the local tavern, The Red Griffin, at midnight. I have information about a valuable artifact that's hidden somewhere in the city. Be careful, though - there are those who would love to get their hands on it."

What do you do?

1. Head to the tavern early to scope out the situation
2. Spend the day gathering information and gear before meeting with your contact
3. Ignore the message and look for other opportunities

Please respond with one of the above options.
You: 1
Agent: You arrive at The Red Griffin tavern earlier than midnight, curiosity getting the better of you. As you enter, the bard in the corner raises an eyebrow and strums a few notes on his lute, drawing attention to your presence.

The tavern is dimly lit, with only a few patrons scattered about. You notice a figure sitting at the bar, hood up and face obscured. They seem out of place among the rowdy patrons, but you can't quite put your finger on why.

As you take a seat at the bar, the bartender, a gruff-looking man with a thick beard, looks you up and down before nodding in greeting. "What can I get ya?"

You order a drink and take a moment to survey the tavern. The patrons are a mix of locals and travelers, all enjoying their drinks and conversation. You notice a few interesting characters:

* A group of dwarves in the corner, laughing and clinking mugs together
* A lone figure sitting at a table near the fire, hood up and face obscured (you recognize this person as your contact)
* A pair of shady-looking individuals huddled in the shadows, eyeing the other patrons with suspicion

Your contact catches your eye and raises their mug in a silent toast. They nod slightly, indicating that you can approach them.

**Rolling for Stealth:**

As you approach the bar, you roll for stealth to see how well you blend in. With your Dexterity score of 18, you manage to slip into the background unnoticed.

**Result:** 1d20 + 5 (Dexterity modifier) = 14

You make it to the table without drawing attention to yourself.

What do you do now?

1. Approach your contact and strike up a conversation
2. Take a seat at an empty table and observe the tavern patrons
3. Join in with the dwarves' celebration, hoping to gather more information

Please respond with one of the above options.
You: /exit

Analysis:
This change to temperature immediately proved to help as the model does feel a bit more rigid and the story seemed to flow more how I would like.

I believe that 0.7 temperature forces the model to be less random in its choices.

---------------------------------
The model is at where I would like it for now and so I shall conclude the tests for this lab.
